Kindle Signage
==============

For python 3.5+

Tested on a Kindle Touch (first gen) with OS version 5.3.7.3

Repository for my experiments with an old Kindle Touch for use as digital signage.

The project consists of a few scripts for a jailbroken kindle and a python server for the images.

The python server will deliver an updated image suitable for display.
